	//interface in java is mechanism to achieve abstraction 
	//there can be only abstract method in java interface // not method body
	//it  is used to achieve abstraction and multiple +hybrid inheritance
	//other word we can that interface on only abstract method and variable 
	//it cannot have a method body
	
	// feature of interface 
	//1 variable declared inside the interface are by default static and final
	//2 variable declared inside the interface are by default public and abstract
	//3 Constructor concept is not applicable for interface
	//4 object of interface can not be created
	//5 interface support multiple inheritance 
	//6 we can achieve 100% abstraction in interface
	
	// final =final keyword that can be used to modify a variable a method or a class-+

	
	//final keyword makes the variable a constant which means that it value cannot be changed once it has been assign to the value
